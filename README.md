# About-Me
My name is Josh Blecherman. I am a rising Junior at NYU. 

The projects on my GitHub profile are exclusively things I have done in my personal time, as I am not sure if I am allowed to put school related projects publicly on my profile, but feel free to ask me about some of the projects I have done in school! 

I started programming in my junior and senior years of High School in Java. Since then, I've learned to use languages like Python, C++, and javascript with varying degrees of proficiency. I would say I'm currently best at using Python and C++, but I'd love to expand my horizons! 

I have some experience with the React framework (See my Visualization-Tool repo) but I can't say I am comfortable using it. I also used some bootstrap in the navigation bar for that project.
